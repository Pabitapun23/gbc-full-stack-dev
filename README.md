# Web Applications - Full Stack Development

This is the repository for all the web application projects I made during my Full Stack Development course.

## Projects :

It is a **web application** for the **library management system**. Here, users can borrow and return the available books.
I built this web application using **NodeJs, ExpressJs, MongoDB, Handlebars, HTML, and CSS**.

### 2. Music App
